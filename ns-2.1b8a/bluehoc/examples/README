Example Bluetooth simulations 
=============================

The naming convention for the files is:

simXYZ.tcl

where
X = no. of FTP apps. 
Y = no. of Telnet apps. 
Z = no. of Voice sources.

The output file for nam traces is 'out.nam'. 
The size of nam files generated varies from 
around 2-30 MB, depending upon the following 
factors:

(1) No of devices (broadcasted packets during inquiry/paging are 
     transmitted on all links). 
(2) Time spent in inquiry and paging. This determines how many 
     packets are braodcasted. The maximum duration for inquiry 
     period is Inquiry Timeout. 
(3) Type of application: FTP always has data to send while telnet 
     and voice transmissions are intermittent. 
(4) Simulation time (20 sec for all examples).
