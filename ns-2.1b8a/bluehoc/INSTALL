REQUIREMENTS
============

BLUEHOC2.0 is an extension of ns-2.1b7a. The supported
platforms are Linux, SunOS, BSD and almost any other 
Unix version. 

INSTALLATION
============
STEP 1)
	If you don't already have NS (ns-2.1b7a), download it from 
	(www.isi.edu/nsnam). Use tar -zxvf to inflate it. Let the 
        path of the directory in which NS is inflated be NS_HOME. 

STEP 2) 
	% mv bluehoc2.0-src.tar.gz NS_HOME/ns-allinone-2.1b7a/ns-2.1b7a
	% cd NS_HOME/ns-allinone-2.1b7a/ns-2.1b7a
	Unzip and Untar bluehoc2.0-src.tar.gz using:
	% tar -zxvf bluehoc2.0-src.tar.gz

	The untarred version will have the following directory 
	structure:

			  bluehoc/
			     |
	|------|------|------|---------|-------|--------|------|
     INSTALL LICENSE README examples/ mod/  patches/  src/   tcl/


	The next step is to copy the BLUEHOC C++ and TCL files 
	in the right directories. 

	Copy the C++ source files to the current directory by
	% cp bluehoc/src/*.cc bluehoc/src/*.h .

	Also copy the TCL source file to the directory tcl/lib
	% cp bluehoc/tcl/ns-btnode.tcl tcl/lib/

STEP 3) 
	The next step is to apply patches to some files in
	the NS distribution which have been modified for BLUEHOC. 

	IF YOU ALREADY HAVE NS INSTALLED do the following 
	% cp bluehoc/patches/bt_patch ../
	% cd ..
	% patch -p0 -b < bt_patch

	IF YOU DO NOT HAVE NS INSTALLED do the following
	% cp bluehoc/patches/bt_patch_make ../
	% cd ..
	% patch -p0 -b < bt_patch_make

STEP 4) 
	IF YOU ALREADY HAVE NS INSTALLED 
	% cd ns-2.1b7a
	Note: 	In this case you need to manually add the 
		BLUEHOC C++ files for compilation in OBJ_CC 
		and ns-btnode.tcl in the NS_TCL_LIB macros
		of the Makefile.  
		After this, do
	% make

	IF YOU DO NOT HAVE NS INSTALLED
	Just do:
	% ./install
	and after NS (with Bluetooth extension) is installed successfully:
	% cd ns-2.1b7a

RUNNING THE SIMULATION
======================
Before doing the following make sure that 'xgraph' and 'nam' are 
in your PATH shell variable. These two programs are installed at
the following locations:

xgraph: 	NS_HOME/ns-allinone-2.1b7a/xgraph-12.1/
nam:		NS_HOME/ns-allinone-2.1b7a/nam-1.0a9/

	% mkdir run
	% cp bluehoc/tcl/*.tcl bluehoc/examples/*.tcl run/
	% cd run

	You can test-run the example files simXYZ.tcl by:
	% ../ns simXYZ.tcl 

	Now the command
	% wish bluehoc.tcl

	will start a graphical interface which will help 
	you through in configuring BLUEHOC

Please report any installation problems on the BLUEHOC project page.
