This directory contains the following files

1) bluehoc.tcl (Requires 'wish')

   This is a Tcl/TK based Graphical Interface for configuration
   and running the simulation. 

   The configuration parameters which are set using the GUI 
   are written into the output tcl file which the user selects. 

   After the configuration is complete and the user saves the 
   script file, it is automatically run. Actions like plotting
   graphs, getting nam traces etc are performed if the user
   selects the options. 

   The script file can also be run using ../ns <script> after 
   installation from run/ directory. 


2) proc.tcl and run.tcl

   The simulation script created in 1) includes these two files. 
   These files perform the actual configuration given the values
   for configuration parameters. 


3) ns-btnode.tcl defines the class BTNode which represents a 
   Bluetooth node.
