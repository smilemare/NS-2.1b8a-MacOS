**********************************************
Files in mod/ dir should not be required for 
installation if you are using ns-2.1b7a
**********************************************

This directory contains the modified NS files
for which the patches are provided. The patch
should work for ns-2.1b7a, however these files
can be used to make the changes manually:

Follow steps 1) and 2) from ../INSTALL. 
instead of step 3) do the following:

Take backups of files in ns-2.1b7a and ns-2.1b7a/tcl/lib
directories with same names as files in mod/ dir. Then
copy the modified files in the right directories:

    % cp bluehoc/mod/*.cc bluehoc/mod/*.h .
    % cp bluehoc/mod/*.tcl tcl/lib/

Follow step 4) however in both cases the Note
in ../INSTALL has to be followed.
